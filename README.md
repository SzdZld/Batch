# Batch
Batch files what I personally like to use.Just write what I want to write

NONE.
It's no necessary to read README.md（hahaha,It's a joke)
These are the almost useless things that I came up with during my break. 
Feel free to come up with suggestions or comments.
At the moment there is nothing here, maybe there will be later.

OK.Today is Apr.11 2023
I delete Hash calculate（MD5）.bat because the new file ---Hash calculate.bat--- can calculate ALL hash algorithms that come with windows.
But I know it's in Chinese, which is not good, so I'm going to write another one in English.
