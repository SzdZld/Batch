# Batch
Batch files what I personally like to use.Just write what I want to write

NONE.
It's no necessary to read README.md（hahaha,It's a joke)
These are the almost useless things that I came up with during my break. 
Feel free to come up with suggestions or comments.
At the moment there is nothing here, maybe there will be later.

OK.Today is Apr.11 2023
I delete Hash calculate（MD5）.bat because the new file ---Hash calculate.bat--- can calculate ALL hash algorithms that come with windows.

Here's how to use it.
1.Drag the file you need to verify into this bat file.
2.You need to choose which hash value do you need to check.(It depends on which verification method is provided on the website where you downloaded the file)
3.The bat file will generate a txt file with the hash of the file.
4.If you have a second file you want to verify, you can also do the same as above, the latter hash will be generated in the second line of the same txt file.

But I know it's in Chinese, which is not good, so I'm going to write another one in English.
